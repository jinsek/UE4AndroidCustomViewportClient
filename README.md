# UE4AndroidCustomViewportClient
fixed the android viewport split vertical direction upside down bug.
this is what I have done, make the game only show in part of the mobile screen. it's easy by modify viewport client a little bit, but it's buggy on android platform, since the uv on android platform is upside down.
